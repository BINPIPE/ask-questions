## How to ask?

This repo is **[https://github.com/BINPIPE/ask-questions](https://github.com/BINPIPE/ask-questions)**

Just [Open an Issue](https://github.com/BINPIPE/ask-questions/issues/new) and write your question.

## What can be asked?

You can ask any/all of the following or beyond-
* Technology 
* Career
* Life

Anything that you feel I or other forum members can help you with.

Keep in mind that it should **not be unethical**.

It should **not be a consulting arrangement**. If you're looking for a consultant ping me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasanjit-singh).

**Not be a stackoverflow question**. You are getting an error in a program and you need me to look into it. Please ask such questions on 
* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), if it's a general programming question.

* or [Telegram group](https://t.me/binpipe), if it's a question related to our youtube video courses or about technology.

## Will all questions be answered?

I'll try my best but understand that I have a full time job and I'm doing this to help as many people as possible. But I have my limits. Any time I spend answering questions is the time I am taking away from my personal learning or my beautiful family.
In short, be patient and empathetic. And you can help!

## How can I help?

There are many ways you can help me do this better:
1. **Search before** raising an issue. See if the question you have is already there or not.
2. **Vote on questions** you like or want to be answered first. Likes or any positive emoji will act as a vote.
3. **Most important!** Ask generic questions, which would be helpful to a lot more people. I'll spend most time on questions which shows potential.
